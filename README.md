# Microservices & Front-End Deployment

This repo contains a Go-based microservices stack and a front-end app. Use the **Makefile** in `project/` to build and run everything.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** – for running services in containers
- **Go 1.21+** – for building binaries locally (optional)
- **Make** – for running the commands below

## Quick Start (Docker)

From the **project** directory:

```bash
cd project
make up_build
```

This will:

1. Build Linux binaries for broker, auth, logger, mail, and listener
2. Bring down any existing stack
3. Build and start all Docker Compose services (broker, auth, logger, mailer, listener, Postgres, Mongo, RabbitMQ, MailHog)

To start existing images without rebuilding:

```bash
cd project
make up
```

To stop the stack:

```bash
cd project
make down
```

## Makefile Targets (run from `project/`)

| Command        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `make up`      | Start all containers in the background (no rebuild) |
| `make up_build` | Build all service binaries, then build and start all containers |
| `make down`    | Stop and remove Docker Compose containers |
| `make build_broker`   | Build broker-service Linux binary only |
| `make build_auth`     | Build authentication-service Linux binary only |
| `make build_logger`   | Build logger-service Linux binary only |
| `make build_mail`     | Build mail-service Linux binary only |
| `make build_listener` | Build listener-service Linux binary only |
| `make build_front`    | Build front-end binary (current OS) |
| `make start`   | Build and run the front-end app (e.g. `./frontApp`) in the background |
| `make stop`    | Stop the front-end app process |

## Service Ports (when using Docker Compose)

- **Broker**: `8080` → 80 (internal)
- **Authentication**: `8081` → 80 (internal)
- **Postgres**: `5432`
- **Mongo**: `27017`
- **RabbitMQ**: `5672`
- **MailHog SMTP**: `1025` (API/ui: `8025`)

## Front-End (standalone)

To build and run the front-end without Docker:

```bash
cd project
make build_front
make start
```

To stop it:

```bash
make stop
```

The front-end serves on port 80 by default.

## Project Layout

- **project/** – Docker Compose, Makefile, and db-data volumes
- **broker-service/** – API gateway / broker
- **authentication-service/** – User auth (Postgres)
- **logger-service/** – Log storage (MongoDB, RPC, gRPC)
- **mail-service/** – SMTP mail sender
- **listener-service/** – RabbitMQ consumer (log/auth events)
- **front-end/** – Web UI

Each service has its own README with a description and code structure.
